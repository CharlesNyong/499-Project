# 499-Project
4th year project

                                                        Datawarehouse System              
                                      
  The goal of this project is to build a warehouse system that stores sales and other relevant information from an online retail database for the purpose of analysis and history. The system provides a chart that allows users to perform analysis on the data in the warehouse.
 
 
                                                           Installation
                                                           
To see how this system works, you will need to install it locally. To install this system you will need the following:

- Download Appserv apache server from https://www.appserv.org/en/

- After setting up the local server, create two databases called "project_499" and "retail_warehouse" using the "phpMyAdmin" web tool       available with this server. 

- Upload the script files in the "Databases" repository to populate the database with data

- Download the files in this repository into a folder name "499_Project" (create this folder).  

- Upon successfull completion of steps 1-4, you should be able to use the link http://localhost/499_Project/queries/wareHouseLogin.php to   access the query system interface (This is where you can perform all sort of analysis on the data in the warehouse)
